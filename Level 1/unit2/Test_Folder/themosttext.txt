[Verse 1]
Think of these thoughts as limitless light
Exposing closing circuitry of fright
Think of each moment holding this breath
As death minute in decimal

[Verse 2]
Resident minor, how do you plead?
We'll need your testimony on the stand (Service of the fee fi fo fum)
Solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
So help you, son, now raise your right hand

[Verse 3]
Father, your honor, may I explain?
My brain has claimed its glory over me
I've a good heart albeit enasni
Condemn him to the infirmary
[Chorus 1]
All mine towers crumble down
The flowers gasping under rubble
Shrieking in the hall of lull
Thy genius sates a thirst for trouble

[Verse 4]
Scattering sparks of thought energy
Deliver me and carry me away
Here in my kingdom, I am your lord
I order you to cower and pr√¶y

[Chorus 2]
Nuns commence incanting (Axon dendrite) (Help me, help me)
As the lightning strikes mine temples thus (Help me, help me)
Electrifying mine chambers wholly (Help me, help me)
Scorching out thine sovereignty (Help me, help me)

[Post-Chorus]
So spiraling down thy majesty
I beg of thee, have mercy on me
I was just a boy, you see
I plead of thee, have sympathy for me

[Bridge]
See how the serfs work the ground (See how they fall)
And they give it all they've got (Fall)
And they give it all they've got (Fall)
And you give it all you've got till you're down (Fall)
(Ha ha ha ha!)
See how the brain plays around
And you fall inside a hole you couldn't see
And you fall inside a hole inside a
Someone help me
Understand what's going on inside my mind
Doctor, I can't tell if I'm not me (Not you, huh?)

[Verse 5]
When it grows bright, the particles start to
Marvel having made it through the night
Never they ponder whether electric
Calming if you look at it right
