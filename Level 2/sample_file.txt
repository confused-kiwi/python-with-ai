Today at school we got assigned to reading groups. They don’t come right out and tell you if you’re in
the Gifted group or the Easy group, but you can figure it out right away by looking at the covers of the
books they hand out.
I was pretty disappointed to find out I got put in the Gifted group, because that just means a lot of extra
work. When they did the screening at the end of last year, I did my best to make sure I got put in the
Easy group this year.
